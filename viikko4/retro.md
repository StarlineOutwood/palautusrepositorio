Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel is a retrospective method to
see how the team is doing. It is done by drawing a circle and dividing it 
into five sectors, named like in the name of the method. Then tose sectors 
are filled with different comments. Start sector is filled with things the 
team should start doing, but hasn't started doing yet. Stop sector includes 
things that the team has done before but no longer find useful or beneficial. 
Continue is for things that work just fine and the team should keep on doing. 
More of and less of are quite self-explanatory: those are the things we want 
to do more of or less of in the future.

Glad, Sad, Mad method categorizez all the issues, observations and changes
into three boxes: Glad, Sad or Mad. After this the team votes on the issues 
and they are discussed fromt he most important (most votes) to the least 
important).
